What an amazing year playa! I'm feeling amazed at the time of writing this post. It makes me really happy to relive those moments while expressing them in words here. From being youngest entrepreneur of the year to learning new paradigms. Every challenge which hit me last year appeard hard at initial attempt or even at subsciquent attempts but, "Lemme try this once more" kept me there hanging.

<!-- more -->

I did explore a lot of different things last year. Startups, traveling, new programming languages, new skills and even reading and writing. I got a amazon kindle at the very end of the year, I should have ordered it way before nevertheless, I carry it along with me all the time possible and I make sure to read books. I'm also pushing myself to regularly write something coz I really want to improve on that.

I want to mention about my decisions made last year, lot of them were not fullproof or didn't came with any safety advice. I just made them at the last moment regardlessly coz I believe in them. Ironically, the last moment or those unplanned decisions turned out as a life changer compared to those planned ones which were based on all sorts of metrics, _how not to fail_ and _play safe_ etc.

## So what's next...

I want to keep experiementing with the opportunities out there and keep myself engaged in the process of learning, reading, writing and ofcourse meeting new like minded people.

I've a bad habit of leaving goals in the middle which I started passionately whether its a blog post lying in my drafts, Startup ideas, pet projects or some interesting thing which I wanted to complete. I definitely have to learn how to focus and be in that mindset until I finish them.

I can't end this post without mentioning my afire for Entrepreneurship and how eagar I'm to get something out there used by real people. I do want to try out some new ideas I've and I feel they might result good.

I want to make this year count more than the last and wanna play some more risky bets.
