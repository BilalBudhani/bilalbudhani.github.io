    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Expect the unexpected and whenever possible be the unexpected</p></blockquote>

<p>As you might know I&rsquo;m crazy about quotes and I try to&nbsp;correlate my each blog post with them. The above mentioned quote is perfectly fits for this one.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m very Young Entrepreneur who have just begun my Entrepreneurship journey 3 months back with my idea which I called &lsquo;AdsHub&rsquo; also with a vision to create a dent in the universe, I&rsquo;ll talk about this in detail but in some other blog post. Today, I&rsquo;m writing this post to share my&nbsp;delightful experience of getting awarded as Star Young Entrepreneur of the year 2013 by 6th Indira India Innovation Summit.</p>

<p>A month back from now I received an email from the officials of the event stating</p>

<blockquote>May I request to confirm your presence and graciously agree to accept the award in person at the &ldquo;<b>6th Indira International Innovation Summit 2013</b>&rdquo;.</blockquote>


<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe at first that this is something happening with me that too at such an early stage. I controlled my excitement from bursting, didn&rsquo;t shared this news with anyone with a hypothesis that it may be false or I interpreted it wrong&nbsp; and wrote an email back confirming. After, receiving a positive reply I jumped out of my seat and shouted in crazy manner to all my&nbsp;colleagues informing them about the award.</p>

<p>Venue was far from my place (Mumbai) i.e Pune, but I was least bothered about the travelling part, Crossing all the hurdles I reached the venue on time. It was a grand event (at least for me) where I was called as &lsquo;Awardee&rsquo; first time in my life. Remarkable hospitality and even more remarkable arrangements. After, giving away awards to 3 categories which was before mine. I was called on the stage with other Entrepreneurs who were awarded in the same category. Being in nervous state (which you can gauge by looking in the video below) but, Somehow I manage to utter some words on the stage, Below is my speech (taken from my Samsung galaxy S2 so excuse the quality)</p>

<p>Concluding the post, It was such a powerful capsule for early Entrepreneur like me that amplified my motivations and made my vision more strong. My year started with something very awesome&hellip; I hope this is just the start there are lot more opportunities calling me to tap them and I&rsquo;ll try my level best to do so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier last week I was checking out <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> (as what I follow religiously). I stumbled upon on an article which took my interest <a href="http://www.vijayanand.name/2012/12/india-has-a-drought-not-of-investors-but-customers/">India has a drought &ndash; not of Investors, but Customers</a> it was a great read. As the guy who wrote this was Indian I decided to do some research and get a background who is he and what he do. The result was stunning, He was <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayanands">Vijay Anand</a> a well known Indian Entrepreneur who is behind <a href="http://thestartupcentre.com">The Startup Centre</a> I also came to know that these people have something called <a href="http://www.in50hrs.com/">in50hrs</a>. <!-- more --> Since I came to know about this it created an impression on my mind. Fortunately, in50hrs were conducting an event in Pune that too in couple of days after I came to know about it without giving a second thought I registered for the event.</p>

<p>I was unsure about my idea <a href="http://adshub.net">AdsHub</a> which I planned to work on in the event. However, I somehow convince myself to stick to the plan and so I left from Mumbai for Pune to attend the event with one of my friend who is working on the idea with me.</p>

<p>We reached Pune (10:30am) way before the specified time for the event all thanks to my friend who was in charge for tickets. After, Struggling a lot to kill the time we successfully arrived at the venue.</p>

<h2>Game begins</h2>

<p>There was around 30 people in the auditorium and IdeaSmiths were ready to present their ideas. Almost after 8 ideas we got the chance to present our idea. I could feel the audience interest towards our idea but, my bad presentation skill and nervousness made me think that I missed the opportunity. Hosts of the event then announced that there will be a voting session for the ideas so that everyone gets a team to get started. Each person can vote 3 ideas including their own idea. Me and my friend voted for our idea and 2 other ideas which we felt were good. I was stunned to know we got the 2nd highest voting, <strong>iWish</strong> by two microsoft employees was leading. We both were&nbsp;surprised and excited at the same time after knowing the results.</p>

<p>Controlling our excitement and answering almost everyone&rsquo;s questions which were raised after the presentation. We started our work for the demo which was scheduled after 50 hours. Our goal for the event was to brainstorm ourself by figuring out how we gonna take this idea forward, what are the limitations and more importantly walk out with a clear vision about the idea. There were mentors available at the event to help you plan and build an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>, These people were extremely friendly, knowledgable, helpful, experienced etc. etc. <em>(limiting myself I hope you got their phenomena)</em>. Each of them took us one step forward towards our goal mentally and made us believe in ourself <em>(and of course in idea too)</em>.</p>

<p>Every iteration on the idea was empowering our vision and <a href="https://twitter.com/BilalBudhani/status/279902765709398016">kept us engaged</a>. Also, we were surrounded by interesting people whom I highly appreciate for listening to my point of view in healthy debets, helping me to draft an about us page and putting efforts to make us believe that Microsoft is a good company :P.</p>

<p>After all the efforts, fun and <a href="https://twitter.com/prats3112/status/280102907511185408">sleepless nights</a> it was time for the <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tripad/status/280288068081184769">demo</a> with around ~50 audience and <a href="https://twitter.com/santoshdawara/status/280554699411828736">3 judges</a>. We were placed at 6th. Somehow managing my nervousness I went on the stage and started <a href="https://twitter.com/prats3112/status/280624679612473344">my speech</a>. The response was overwhelming, I could see the curiosity in those eyes which were stuck on me. Demo session was followed by a snacks and networking break, after which we left for our place.</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>

<p>Overall it was a great unforgettable experience for us. We achieved lot more than what we&rsquo;ve aimed for, also some awesome new friends to take back home. Kudos to <a href="http://www.in50hrs.com">in50hrs team</a> keep rocking :).</p>
