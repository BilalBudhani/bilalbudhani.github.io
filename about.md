  Hey there! Feel free to drop me a line or tweet me if you're working on something interesting. I'm always up for a quick chat. :)

Hi. I'm Bilal Budhani. I'm an [award winning Entrepreneur](/2013/01/13/star-young-entrepreneur-of-the-year-2013/), Self taught developer, Prototype builder and a technology enthusiast. I've been building software products since past 8+ years for various startups (including mine). Though, I've done my graduation in Finance field but that never managed to keep me away from programming. I've been coding since my early college days because I enjoy that experience of building products myself thoroughly.

I love working on Ruby and JavaScript but, I also have hands on experience with devOps, iOS (Swift), Bash, SQL and NoSQL databases. You can checkout my [linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/bilalbudhani) profile to get a full overview of my skillset. Besides, I'm also an organiser of [Mumbai Ruby Group](https://www.meetup.com/MumbaiRB/) and [Mumbai JavaScript Group](https://www.meetup.com/Mumbai-JavaScript-Meetup/).

Here is the list of products which I was fortunate enough to be a part of:

* [AdsHub](http://adshub.net)
* [Tickmatic](http://tickmatic.in)
* [ValuePitch](http://valuepitch.com/)
* [Recommendly](http://recommend.ly/)
* [SupportBee](http://supportbee.com/)
* [WhatsNew](http://whatsnew.io/)
* [Embibe](http://embibe.com/)
* [Crowdfire](http://crowdfireapp.com/) (Previously JustUnfollow)

## OpenSource

I'm a huge supporter of Open Sources and I try to payback to the community however I can. Here is the list of some open source contributions I made:

* [ChartAngular](https://github.com/BilalBudhani/ChartAngular) - A set of charting directives build using AngularJS and RaphaelJS.
* [BlockquoteBreak](https://github.com/BilalBudhani/blockquote_break) - A Gmail like inline reply plugin for Redactor.
* [SimpleProvision](https://github.com/BilalBudhani/simple_provision) - Bake servers using normal Bash scripts written in Ruby.
