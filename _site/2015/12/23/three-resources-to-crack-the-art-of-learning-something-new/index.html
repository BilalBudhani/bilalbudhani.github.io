  <span class="post-date">23 Dec 2015</span>
  <div class="message">
  These are the lists of resources I read / watch before I begin learning something entirely new. I hope it helps you.
</div>

<p>I‚Äôm always fascinated by the thrill of learning something new. It adds enormous value to my mental and physical being. It even helps me see things from a different perspective and shapes my overall thinking process in an impactful manner.</p>

<p>As much as I enjoy the struggle in the process of throwing myself into various scenarios and letting my brain to deal with it, I also make sure I acquire the skill at a faster pace by figuring out important and essential aspects and making immediate use of the learnings in real world to validate the path.</p>

<p>Learning is an inevitable truth of life, so why not crack this art and make this path easier and interesting. Here is my list of resources which helped me to look through this art.</p>

<h3><a href="http://sivers.org/kimo">There‚Äôs no speed limit. (The lessons that changed my life)</a> by Derek Sivers</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>If you‚Äôre more driven than ‚Äújust anyone‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can do so much more than anyone expects. And this applies to ALL of life‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot just school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This blog post was introduced to me by <a href="https://twitter.com/prateekdayal">Prateek Dayal</a>. Ever since I read it, It changed my approach towards learning. Arbitrary time attached to adopt a skill is made keeping everyone in mind. You can always speed up the process and overcome the learning curve.</p>

<h3>Smashing fear, Learn anything by Tim Ferris</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm amazed by the amount of things this guy has achieved in his life so far, both at a personal and professional level. His approach of deconstructing the learning curve and applying the famous ‚ÄúPareto‚Äôs 80/20 theory‚Äù to almost everything is the secret sauce behind his success.</p>

<h3>The first 20 hours‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHow to learn anything by Josh Kaufman</h3>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MgBikgcWnY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In this talk Josh Kaufman talks about how his obsession with learning new things lead him to ‚ÄúThe first 20 hours‚Äù principle. Which is basically, learning the most common stuff about the task in the first 20 hours and produce enough result to generate momentum.</p>
