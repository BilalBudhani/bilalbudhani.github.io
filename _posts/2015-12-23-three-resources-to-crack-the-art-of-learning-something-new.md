Learning is an inevitable truth of life, so why not crack this art and make this path easier and interesting. Here is my list of resources which helped me to look through this art.

In this talk Josh Kaufman talks about how his obsession with learning new things lead him to “The first 20 hours” principle. Which is basically, learning the most common stuff about the task in the first 20 hours and produce enough result to generate momentum.
